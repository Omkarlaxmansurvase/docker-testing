- **MAE:** ₹1,890
- **Evaluation Dataset:** 20% holdout test set

---

## 4. Privacy and Data Protection

### 4.1 Data Privacy
- **No Personal Data:** Model uses only technical specifications
- **No User Tracking:** API does not store user queries
- **GDPR Compliance:** No personal identifiable information (PII) collected

### 4.2 Data Security
- Model artifacts stored securely
- API endpoints do not log sensitive information
- Regular security audits recommended

### 4.3 Consent
- Training data sourced from publicly available information
- No consent required as no personal data is collected
- Users informed of prediction nature through API documentation

---

## 5. Robustness and Reliability

### 5.1 Model Validation
- Cross-validation performed during training
- Separate test set for unbiased evaluation
- Regular retraining schedule recommended (quarterly)

### 5.2 Data Drift Monitoring
- Implemented drift detection for input features
- Alert system for significant distribution changes
- Automatic retraining triggers when drift exceeds threshold

### 5.3 Error Handling
- Input validation to prevent invalid predictions
- Confidence intervals provided with predictions
- Clear error messages for out-of-range inputs

---

## 6. Accountability and Governance

### 6.1 Ownership
- **Model Owner:** [Your Name/Team]
- **Last Updated:** October 2025
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Contact:** [Email/GitHub]
